While the original algorithm is designed for open curves, Vision Magic adapted it for closed shapes. We cut a closed path into 4 sections, simplify each, and stitch them back together after path simplification. We choose the north most, east most, south most and west most points to cut a given path. Effectively the simplest possible shape is a diamond with four points. However in practice, it is not desirable to have shapes with sharp corners, and so we would smooth them with a 4-point scheme as described in VTracer.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"fidelity\"\n    }}>{`Fidelity`}</h3>\n    <p>{`It has to be understood that statistically there are exponentially more nodes as we decrease the cluster size. There is one root node known as the image background, but as many leaf nodes as there are number of pixels. As such, fidelity is actually a cutoff which we discard all clusters smaller than a desired size. When this cutoff threshold is low, we are removing salt and pepper noise but in a true color sense. As we increase this cutoff, structures are being discarded. Further increasing this cutoff, the image would become more abstract, and in the end only one solid background will be left.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It is important to note that this background color is not the mean pixel color of the image, but is the average color of the largest cluster, which conceptually is the ‘base tone’ of the given image.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"color-levels\"\n    }}>{`Color Levels`}</h3>\n    <p>{`More color levels mean finer gradient.

Setting color levels to 16 meaning a cluster has to have at least a color difference of 16 in order to be considered a separate cluster with the cluster on the upper level. In effect, tuning down the color levels would create a retro 8-bit color look.
