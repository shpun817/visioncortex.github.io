# Vision Cortex - Semantic Computer Vision

The goal of Semantic Computer Vision is to allow computers to understand the content of images and graphics as intended and perceived by humans, and construct a high level representation of such information.

This technology can be embodied in different applications:

## Image simplification and segmentation

We developed [Impression](/visionmagic-docs), a family of algorithms for image simplification, segmentation and vectorization. It allows us to control the amount of visual information in an image in a quantitative manner.

## Image Vectorization

<img style={{width: 100 + '%'}} src={'public/images/vtracer-demo.svg'}/>

We developed [VTracer](//www.visioncortex.org/vtracer/), a utility to convert raster images (like jpg & png) into vector graphics (svg). Our graphics pipeline is able to process high resolution scans and photographs and trace the content to output compact vector files.

## Optical Character Recognition

We are developing a new Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine from the ground up specifically for pictorial languages like Chinese, Korean and Japanese (CKJ). There are several aspects we would like to push the state of the art forward:

1. Improve recognition accuracy on Chinese, Korean and Japanese

2. Extract text from complex graphics

3. Recognize text in wide range of font sizes, families and styles

4. Deliver contextual information like paragraphing and font style

## About Us

The research group is led by alumnus [Chris Tsang](//github.com/tyt2y3) conjoining with several students and alumni from [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](//www.ust.hk): [Billy Chan](//github.com/billy1624), [Hill Tse
](//github.com/hilltse) and [Sanford Pun](//github.com/shpun817).

We are actively looking for researchers and developers to engage in this R & D project. If you are interested in doing a FYP or thesis related to this topic, let's get [in touch](mailto:info@thf.technology) immediately.

We promise to release the eventual outcome of this project as open source software under a permissive license and continue to develop and maintain it over the years to come.
