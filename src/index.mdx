# Vision Cortex - Semantic Computer Vision

The goal of Semantic Computer Vision is to allow computers to understand the content of graphics designed by humans, and construct a high level representation of such information.

This technology can be embodied in different applications:

## Raster to Vector graphics conversion

We developed [VTracer](//www.visioncortex.org/vtracer/), a program to convert raster images (like jpg & png) into vector graphics (svg). Our graphics pipeline is able to process complex graphics as well as photographs and trace the curves optimally to output highly compressed vector files.

## Optical Character Recognition

We are developing a new Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine from the ground up specifically for pictorial languages like Chinese, Korean and Japanese. There are still several aspects we would like to push forward:

1. Improve recognition accuracy on pictorial languages like Chinese, Korean and Japanese

2. Extract and recognize text from complex graphics

3. Extract contextual information like paragraphing and font style

The output of our engine is an abstract representation with semantic information, which composes of a hierarchy of text, from groups, paragraphs, sentences to characters. In addition, stylistic information like font weight, size and color will be carried.
