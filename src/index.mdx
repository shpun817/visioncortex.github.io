# Vision Cortex - Semantic Computer Vision

The goal of Semantic Computer Vision is to allow computers to understand the content of images and graphics as intended and perceived by humans, and construct a high level representation of such information.

This technology can be embodied in different applications:

## Symbolic Barcode

We developed [SymCode](/symcode-docs), a 2D barcode designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable.

## Image Simplification

<img style={{width: 100 + '%'}} src={'public/images/visionmagic-preview.png'}/>

We developed [Impression](/impression-docs), a family of algorithms for image simplification and segmentation. It allows us to control the amount of visual information in an image in a quantitative manner.

## Image Vectorization

<img style={{width: 100 + '%'}} src={'public/images/vtracer-demo.svg'}/>

We developed [VTracer](/vtracer-docs), a utility to convert raster images (like jpg & png) into vector graphics (svg). Our graphics pipeline is able to process high resolution scans and photographs and trace the content to output compact vector files.

## Optical Character Recognition

We are developing a new Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine from the ground up specifically for pictorial languages like Chinese, Korean and Japanese (CKJ) to encompass wider character sets and font variations.

## About Us

The research group is led by alumnus [Chris Tsang](//github.com/tyt2y3) conjoining with several students and alumni from [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](//www.ust.hk): [Sanford Pun](//github.com/shpun817), [Hill Tse
](//github.com/hilltse) and [Bobby Ng](//github.com/bobbyng626).

We are actively looking for researchers and developers to engage in this R & D project. If you are interested in doing a FYP or thesis related to this topic, let's get [in touch](//github.com/tyt2y3).

We promise to release the eventual outcome of this project as open source software and continue to develop it over the years to come.
