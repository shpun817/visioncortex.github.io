# Vision Cortex - Semantic Computer Vision

The goal of Semantic Computer Vision is to allow computers to understand the content of graphics designed by humans, and construct a high level representation of such information.

This technology can be embodied in different applications:

## Raster to Vector graphics conversion

We developed [VTracer](//www.visioncortex.org/vtracer/), a program to convert raster images (like jpg & png) into vector graphics (svg). Our graphics pipeline is able to process complex graphics as well as photographs and trace the curves optimally to output highly compressed vector files.

## Optical Character Recognition

We are developing a new Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine from the ground up specifically for pictorial languages like Chinese, Korean and Japanese (CKJ). There are several aspects we would like to push the state of the art forward:

1. Improve recognition accuracy on Chinese, Korean and Japanese

2. Extract text from complex graphics

3. Recognize text in wide range of font sizes, families and styles

4. Deliver contextual information like paragraphing and font style

The output of our engine is an abstract representation with semantic information, which composes of a hierarchy of text, from paragraphs, sentences to characters. In addition, stylistic information like font weight, size and color will be delivered.

## About Us

The research group is led by alumnus [Chris Tsang](//github.com/tyt2y3) conjoining with several students and alumni from [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](//www.ust.hk): [Billy Chan](//github.com/billy1624), [Hill Tse
](//github.com/hilltse) and [Sanford Pun](//github.com/shpun817).

We are actively looking for researchers and developers to engage in this R & D project. If you are interested in doing a FYP or thesis related to this topic, let's get [in touch](mailto:info@thf.technology) immediately.

We promise to release the outcome of this project as open source software under a permissive license and continue to develop and maintain it over the years to come.
